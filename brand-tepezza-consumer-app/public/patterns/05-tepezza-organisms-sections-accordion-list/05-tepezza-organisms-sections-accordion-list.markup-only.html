            <p class="">When you have TED, your body’s immune system attacks the tissue behind your eyes. This causes the eyelids and areas around and behind your eyes to become red, swollen, and painful.</p>
            <p class=""> The swelling can also cause your eyes to push forward, or bulge, and prevent your eyelids from closing completely. You may also have other symptoms such as dry/gritty eyes, watery eyes, blurred vision, and sensitivity to light.</p>

            <p class="">TED is a progressive disease, which means it gets worse over time. When you first develop TED, it is progressive (or “active”). During this time, symptoms like eye bulging, pain, redness, and swelling appear and can change or continue to get worse. The progressing (or “active”) phase of TED can last for as little as 6 months or up to 3 years.</p>
            <p class=""> Over time, the progressing (or “active”) phase of TED changes, and scar tissue forms. During this non-progressing (or “inactive”) phase, symptoms such as redness and swelling may get better. Even though symptoms may improve, there could be permanent damage to the eyes. This is why it is important to get treatment for TED as early as possible before damage becomes permanent.</p>

            <p class=""><b>Smoking:</b> People who smoke are 8 times more likely to develop TED. Smoking can also make TED worse and may make treatment less effective. </p>
            <p class=""><b>Gender:</b> Women are 5 times more likely than men to develop TED.</p>
            <p class=""><b>Age:</b> TED occurs most often when people are in their 40s or in their 60s.</p>
            <p class=""><b>Radioactive iodine:</b> This is a medicine used to treat Graves’ disease. It can increase the chances of getting TED and can make TED worse. </p>
            <p class=""><b>Thyroid problems:</b> Graves’ disease and other thyroid conditions, such as Hashimoto’s disease and hyperthyroidism, are known risk factors for TED. </p>
            <p class=""><b>Family history:</b> Thyroid conditions often run in families. If a family member develops a condition that affects his or her thyroid, you may be at increased risk for developing one too.</p>
